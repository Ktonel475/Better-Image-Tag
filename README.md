### Why This Project

Originally, I was using pinterest as image reference library, as it's the best one that I can search from anywhere, any device convinently. However, I notice the site flooding with enormous amount of AI work and nsfw material (ads) which I wasn't intented to have them. I think to myself, why don't I just use obsidian for it, and here's how come this project.
